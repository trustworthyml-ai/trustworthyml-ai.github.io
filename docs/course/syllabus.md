## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles, methods, and applications of trustworthy machine learning. Students will learn to design, implement, and evaluate ML systems that are fair, robust, transparent, privacy-preserving, and accountable. The course combines theoretical foundations with hands-on projects using real-world datasets and modern tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Understand Core Concepts**: Define and explain the key principles of trustworthy ML including fairness, robustness, interpretability, privacy, and accountability
2. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Recognize potential sources of bias, adversarial attacks, and privacy leaks in ML systems
3. **Apply Mitigation Techniques**: Implement state-of-the-art methods for bias mitigation, adversarial defense, and privacy protection
4. **Evaluate Systems**: Use appropriate metrics and evaluation frameworks to assess the trustworthiness of ML models
5. **Design Solutions**: Architect end-to-end trustworthy ML systems for real-world applications
