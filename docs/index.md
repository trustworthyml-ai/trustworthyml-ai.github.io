# Trustworthy Machine Learning

Welcome to the comprehensive resource hub for **Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML)**. This site serves as a central repository for course materials, cutting-edge research, and community resources in the rapidly evolving field of trustworthy AI.

## What is Trustworthy ML?

Trustworthy Machine Learning encompasses the principles and practices needed to build AI systems that are:

- **Fair** and unbiased across different populations
- **Robust** to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts  
- **Transparent** and interpretable in their decision-making
- **Privacy-preserving** in how they handle sensitive data
- **Accountable** for their predictions and recommendations

## Course Overview

Our comprehensive course covers the fundamental concepts, state-of-the-art techniques, and practical implementations of trustworthy ML systems. Whether you're a student, researcher, or practitioner, you'll find valuable resources here.
